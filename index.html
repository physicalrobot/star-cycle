            Stars are born within the clouds of dust and scattered throughout most galaxies. A familiar example of such
            as a dust cloud is the Orion Nebula. Turbulence deep within these clouds gives rise to knots with sufficient
            mass that the gas and dust can begin to collapse under its own gravitational attraction. As the cloud
            collapses, the material at the center begins to heat up. Known as a protostar, it is this hot core at the
            heart of the collapsing cloud that will one day become a star. Three-dimensional computer models of star
            formation predict that the spinning clouds of collapsing gas and dust may break up into two or three blobs;
            this would explain why the majority the stars in the Milky Way are paired or in groups of multiple stars.

            In general, the larger a star, the shorter its life, although all but the most massive stars live for
            billions of years. When a star has fused all the hydrogen in its core, nuclear reactions cease. Deprived of
            the energy production needed to support it, the core begins to collapse into itself and becomes much hotter.
            Hydrogen is still available outside the core, so hydrogen fusion continues in a shell surrounding the core.
            The increasingly hot core also pushes the outer layers of the star outward, causing them to expand and cool,
            transforming the star into a red giant.

        <p class="content">

            If the star is sufficiently massive, the collapsing core may become hot enough to support more exotic
            nuclear reactions that consume helium and produce a variety of heavier elements up to iron. However, such
            reactions offer only a temporary reprieve. Gradually, the star's internal nuclear fires become increasingly
            unstable - sometimes burning furiously, other times dying down. These variations cause the star to pulsate
            and throw off its outer layers, enshrouding itself in a cocoon of gas and dust. What happens next depends on
            the size of the core.

            For average stars like the Sun, the process of ejecting its outer layers continues until the stellar core is
            exposed. This dead, but still ferociously hot stellar cinder is called a White Dwarf. White dwarfs, which
            are roughly the size of our Earth despite containing the mass of a star, once puzzled astronomers - why
            didn't they collapse further? What force supported the mass of the core? Quantum mechanics provided the
            explanation. Pressure from fast moving electrons keeps these stars from collapsing. The more massive the
            core, the denser the white dwarf that is formed. Thus, the smaller a white dwarf is in diameter, the larger
            it is in mass! These paradoxical stars are very common - our own Sun will be a white dwarf billions of years
            from now. White dwarfs are intrinsically very faint because they are so small and, lacking a source of
            energy production, they fade into oblivion as they gradually cool down.

            This fate awaits only those stars with a mass up to about 1.4 times the mass of our Sun. Above that mass,
            electron pressure cannot support the core against further collapse. Such stars suffer a different fate as
            described below.
