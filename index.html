            Stars are born within the clouds of dust and scattered throughout most galaxies. A familiar example of such
            as a dust cloud is the Orion Nebula. Turbulence deep within these clouds gives rise to knots with sufficient
            mass that the gas and dust can begin to collapse under its own gravitational attraction. As the cloud
            collapses, the material at the center begins to heat up. Known as a protostar, it is this hot core at the
            heart of the collapsing cloud that will one day become a star. Three-dimensional computer models of star
            formation predict that the spinning clouds of collapsing gas and dust may break up into two or three blobs;
            this would explain why the majority the stars in the Milky Way are paired or in groups of multiple stars.
